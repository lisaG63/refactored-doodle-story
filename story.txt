Once upon a time, there was a girl. she climbed to the highest mountain, and filled her basket with stars.
The stars became very heavy the farther from the mountain she was. But she kept pushing through to the bottom.
However, these were naughty stars. They didn't want the princess to succeed. So they tried to jump out o fthe basket.
There was this one star named Bill and oh boy this one was crazy. Lemme tell you about him. Bill was wanted in several states for 
theft, arson, and rumors have it that he was involved in Kennedy's assasination. Bill pulled out his lighter and set fire the girl's basket. The other stars used this opportunity to flee. In horror, the girl fled down the mountain. Bill grinned as the next phase of his plan was set in motion.
