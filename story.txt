Once upon a time, there was a girl. she climbed to the highest mountain, and filled her basket with stars.
The stars became very heavy the farther from the mountain she was. But she kept pushing through to the bottom.
However, these were naughty stars. They didn't want the princess to succeed. So they tried to jump out of the basket.
There was this one star named Bill and oh boy this one was crazy. Lemme tell you about him. Bill was wanted in several states for 
theft, arson, and rumors have it that he was involved in Kennedy's assasination. Bill pulled out his lighter and set fire the girl's basket. The other stars used this opportunity to flee. In horror, the girl fled down the mountain. Bill grinned as the next phase of his plan was set in motion.
Bill could now finally be free! He used his freedom to finally do what he always wanted to do, start a sub shop.
He signed a bought a small shack on the outskirts of town and set up his business now called the sub shack.
From The Sub Shack he sold the most delishes subs for all people. He was hoping his to put his past life of crime 
behind him after his business started to take off.
