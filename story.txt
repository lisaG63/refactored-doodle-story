Once upon a time, there was a girl. she climbed to the highest mountain, and filled her basket with stars.
The stars became very heavy the farther from the mountain she was. But she kept pushing through to the bottom.
However, these were naughty stars. They didn't want the princess to succeed. So they tried to jump out o fthe basket.
There was this one star named Bill and oh boy this one was crazy. Lemme tell you about him.
